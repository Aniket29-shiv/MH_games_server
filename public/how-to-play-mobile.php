							<span class="mt20">Basic Concepts :</span>
							<span>Sequence</span>
							<h5>A sequence is group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. </h5>
							<h5>For example :</h5>
							<h5>3♥ 4♥ 5♥</h5>
							<h5>3♥ 4♥ and 5♥ are three consecutive cards of the same suit ♥ </h5>
							<h5>A♣ K♣ Q♣ J♣ </h5>
							<h5>A♣, K♣, Q♣ and J♣ are four consecutive cards of the same suit ♣ </h5>
							<span>Set :</span>
							<h5>A set is a group of three or four cards of the same value in different suits. </h5>
							<h5>For example :</h5>
							<h5>A♥ A♣ A♦ </h5>
							<h5>All A’s are of different suits ♥ ♣ ♦ </h5>
							<h5>7♦ 7♣ 7♠ 7♥ </h5>
							<h5>All the 7’s are of different suits ♦ ♣ ♠ ♥</h5>
							<span class="mt20">Note: All the cards in a set have to be of different suits in a rummy game. If two or more cards of the same suit are used to make a set of three or four sets, it will be considered as an invalid set. </span>
							<h5>For example: </h5>
							<h5>K♥ K♥ K♦ </h5>
							<h5>Invalid Set: It has two Ks of the same suit ♥ </h5>
							<h5>7♦ 7♣ 7♦ 7♥ </h5>
							<h5>Invalid Set: It has two 7s of the same suit ♦ </h5>
							<h3>Importance of Joker </h3>
							<p>Two types of jokers are used in rummy. They serve special roles that can help you to win a rummy game. Here’s how to play rummy games with jokers: </p>
							<span>Wild Joker :</span>
							<span>When a rummy game begins, a wild joker is selected randomly from the closed deck that can be used in place of any other card. </span>
							<h5>For example :</h5>
							<h5>If Q ♥ is a wild joker, selected randomly, then Q of any suit can be used as the wild joker.</h5>
							<h5>4♦ 5♦ Q♠ 7♦ </h5>
							<h5>Q♠ has replaced 6♦ to form a sequence of 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ </h5>
							<h5>A♦ Q♣ A♠ A♥ </h5>
							<h5>Q♣ has replaced A♣ to form a set of A♦ A♣ A♠ A♥ </h5>
							<span class="mt20">Printed Joker (PJ): </span>
							<span>Printed jokers also serve the same role in rummy games. If you get printed jokers in your hand, you can use them to replace any other cards to form sets and sequences. </span>
							<h5>For example :</h5>
							<h5>3♦ 4♦ PJ 6♦ </h5>
							<h5>PJ has replaced 5♦ to form a sequence of 3♦ 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ </h5>
							<h5>2♦ PJ 2♠ 2♥ </h5>
							<h5>PJ has replaced 2♣ to form a set of 2♦ 2♣ 2♠ 2♥ </h5>
							<span>Note: If the Printed Joker is randomly selected as the wild joker, then A’s of all suits will become wild jokers in rummy games. </span>
							<h3>Types of Sequences </h3>
							<p>Now, you know that a sequence is group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. You should also know that there are two types of sequences that are used in rummy games. </p>
							<span>Pure Sequence: A pure sequence is group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit that is formed without any joker. </span>
							<h5>For example :</h5>
							<h5>3♥ 4♥ 5♥ </h5>
							<span>Here no joker (printed or wild) is used to form a pure sequence. </span>
							<h5>8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠ 4♠ </h5>
							<h5>Similarly, no joker (printed or wild) is used to form a pure sequence.</h5>
							<span>Impure Sequence: An impure sequence is group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit with one or more jokers. </span>
							<h5>For example :</h5>
							<h5>4♦ 5♦ Q♠ 7♦ </h5>
							<h5>Q♠ is used as a wild joker to replace 6♦ to form a sequence of 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ </h5>
							<h5>8♠ Q♥ 6♠ 5♠ PJ </h5>
							<h5>Here Q♥ (wild joker) and Printed Joker are replacing 7♠ and 4♠ to form a sequence of 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠ 4♠ </h5>
							<h5>Note: Wild Jokers can be used to form pure sequence if they are arranged in the same suit </h5>
							<h5>K♥ Q♥ J♥  </h5>
							<span>Here, even if Q♥ is the wild joker, it can be used to form a pure sequence, as K♥, Q♥ and J♥ are of the same suit ♥ </span>
							<h3>Game Play</h3>
							<p>Rummy is called as one of the most popular card game of picks and discards. This means that you need to: </p>
							<span>(i) First Pick a card from either Closed or Open Deck </span>
							<span>(ii) Then, discard one of the cards in the Open Deck </span>
							<h3>How to Win in Rummy </h3>
							<p>When you have arranged all the cards in your hand in proper sequences and/or sets, including one pure sequence, you need to declare the game by discarding one of the cards in the Finish Slot. After you have declared the rummy game, you need to arrange your cards in proper sequences and/or sets to show them to your opponents and wait for your opponents to show their sequences. </p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Valid Declaration </h3>
							<p>Example #1 : </p>
							<span>A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 4♥| 5♣ 6♣ 7♣ | 8♦ 8♠ 8♣ | K♠ K♦ K♣ </span>
							<img src="cards/correct-valid-pair.png" class="img-responsive"/>
							<span>This is a valid declaration as it meets the objective of the game. </span>
							<h5>(i) All the 13 cards are arranged in valid sequences and sets. </h5>
							<h5>(ii) It has a minimum of two sequences - A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 4♥ and 5♣ 6♣ 7♣. Both are pure sequences and meet the game objective of having at least two sequences, out of which one is a pure sequence. </h5>
							<p class="mt20">Example #2 : </p>
							<span>10♥ is the Wild Joker </span>
							<span>A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 10♥| 5♣ 6♣ 7♣ | 8♦ 8♠ 8♣ | K♠ K♦ K♣ </span>
							<span>This is a valid declaration as it meets the objective of the game. </span>
							<h5>(i) All the 13 cards are arranged in valid sequences and sets. </h5>
							<h5>(ii) It has a minimum of two sequences - 5♣ 6♣ 7♣ and A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 10♥. Here, 5♣ 6♣ 7♣ is a pure sequence and A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 10♥ is an impure sequence. It meets the objective of the game of having at least two sequences, out of which one is a pure sequence. </h5>
							<h3>Wrong Declaration </h3>
							<p>Example #1 : </p>
							<span>A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ | 4♣ 5♣ 6♣ 7♣ | 8♦ 8♦ 8♥ 8♣ | </span>
							<img src="cards/wrong-pair-of-cards.png" class="img-responsive"/>
							<span>A set is group of three or four cards of the same face value with different suits. Here, 8♦ 8♦ 8♥ 8♣ is an invalid set as there are two cards of the same suit - 8♦. </span>
							<p class="mt20">Example #2: Declaring without Sequence</p>
							<span>10♥ is the Wild Joker </span>
							<span>8♦ 8♠ 8♥ | A♦ A♠ A♥ | 9♥ 9♣ 9♥ | 5♦ 5♠ 5♥ 10♥|</span>
							<span>There are no sequences in this example. In order to make a valid declaration, there has to be at least two sequences, out of which one has to be a pure sequence. </span>
							<p class="mt20">Example #3: Declaring without Two Sequences </p>
							<span>10♥ is the Wild Joker </span>
							<span>A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 4♥ | 4♣ 4♠ 10♥ | 8♦ 8♠ 8♥ | 3♦ 3♠ 3♥ |</span>
							<span>There is only one sequence in this example. In order to make a valid declaration, there has to be at least one pure sequence (without Joker) and another sequence (with or without Joker). Here, there is only one sequence and you need to have at least two to make a valid declaration. </span>
							<p class="mt20">Example #4: Declaring without Pure Sequence </p>
							<span>10♥ is the Wild Joker </span>
							<span>A♥ 2♥ 3♥ 4♥ | 4♣ 4♠ 10♥ | 8♦ 8♠ 8♥ | 3♦ 3♠ 3♥ |</span>
							<span>There is only one sequence in this example. In order to make a valid declaration, there has to be at least one pure sequence (without Joker) and another sequence (with or without Joker). Here, there are only impure sequences without any pure sequence. </span>

							<h3>Points in Rummy </h3>
							<p>Winning Points : </p>
							<span>The winner gets zero points </span>
							<p>Losing Points :</p>
							<span>The loser/losers get total points based on their cards. </span>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>High Value Cards </h3>
							<span>A of all suits has 10 points each </span>
							<span>K of all suits has 10 points each </span>
							<span>Q of all suits has 10 points each </span>
							<span>J of all suits has 10 points each </span>
							<span>All jokers, both wild and printed, have zero points. </span>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Other Cards </h3>
							<p>All other cards have the same points as their face numerical value </p>
							<span>For example: </span>
							<h5>8♥ has 8 points </h5>
							<h5>2♠ has 2 points</h5>
							<span>In online Indian Rummy games, if the losing player does not have two sequences along with a pure sequence, the player gets all the card points in his/her hand. However, if the losing player has formed two or more sequences along with a pure sequence, then only the points of the cards that are not in sequence or set are counted in Indian Rummy games online. </span>
							<span>For example: </span>
							<span>If the losing player has the following group of cards, then he/she loses 46 points. </span>
							<h5>Wild Joker :</h5>
							<h5>Q♦ </h5>
							<h5>A♥ 2♥ 3♥ | 5♣ 6♣ Q♦ | 8♦ 8♠ 4♣ | 3♦ 3♣ | K♠ Q♠ </h5>
							<span>Here, the losing player has two sequences - one pure sequence A♥ 2♥ 3♥ and an impure sequence 5♣ 6♣ Q♦. Since the player has two sequences along with a pure sequence, only the points of the unmatched cards will be counted – 8 (8♦) + 8 (8♠) + 4 (4♣) + 3 (3♦) + 3 (3♣) + 10 (K♠) + 10 (Q♠) = 46 points. </span>
							<span>In another example, if the losing player has the following group of cards, then he/she loses 78 points Wild Joker: A♦ </span>
							<h5>4♠ 4♥ 4♣| 4♦ 5♦ A♦ | 3♠ 7♠ 8♠ | Q♦ K♦ | 10♣ 9♣  </h5>
							<span>Here, the losing player has not formed two sequences along with a pure sequence. Therefore, points of all the cards in the hand will be counted – 4 (4♠) + 4 (4♥) + 4 (4♣) + 4 (4♦) + 5 (5♦) + 0 (A♦) + 3 (3♠) + 7 (7♠) + 8 (8♠) + 10 (Q♦) + 10 (K♦) + 10 (10♣) + 9 (9♣) = 78 points </span>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Maximum Limit of Points </h3>
							<p>In 13 Cards online rummy games, a player can get a maximum of 80 points irrespective of the number of high value cards in his/her hand. </p>
							<p>Wrong Declare If have declared without completing the objective or without forming correct sequences and/or sets, you get the sum total of all the points carried by your cards. The maximum points that one can get is 80.</p>
							<p>Drop Feature A player can drop the game by using the drop feature before picking a card from the open/closed deck. </p>
							<span>First Drop: </span>
							<h5>A player gets 10 point in the drop of his/her very first turn </h5>
							<span>Middle Drop:  </span>
							<h5>If a player drops the game after the first turn, he/she gets 30 points. </h5>
							<span>Consecutive Misses: </span>
							<h5>If a player misses three consecutive turns, he/she gets a middle drop and is automatically dropped out of the rummy game. </h5>
							<span>Losing Players with a Valid Hand: </span>
							<h5>Players who declare second with a valid hand get 2 points. So, if you win the game against players who also have a valid hand, the losing players with valid hands get two points. </h5>
							<span>Leave Table: </span>
							<h5>You will get a Middle Drop of 30 points if you leave the Table after drawing a card from the Closed Deck. However, if you leave or drop without seeing the card, you will get the First Drop of 10 points. </h5>
						</div>

							<h3>Calculation in Cash Rummy </h3>
							<p>When you play online rummy for real cash, the points system in cash rummy is based on pre-decided rupee value. The sole winner wins the entire cash amount at the end of every online cash rummy game. </p>
							<p>Winning Cash = (Sum of all points of opponents) X (Rupee value of the point) – Rummysahara.com Fee</p>
							<p>For example, 4 players play rummy games online for real cash on a Rs. 160 Table of Rs 2 per point. If a player wins the game and other 3 players lose with 20, 40 and 50 points, then the winning cash will be calculated as: 2 x (20 + 40 +50) = Rs. 220. This winning amount will be added to the winner’s account after deduction of Rummysahara.com Fee. </p>
